# my1stproject
This is my first mini project in my educational career, and it is a java-based project 
In this project for user validations, 
I used JavaScript HTML and CSS for web development And by using java I created servlets and JSP for frontend connective to backend  
In backend I have used MySQL database for storing the data of users  
Here in this project, I have given an option for both user and admin for sign  
This whole project those who are interested in dance or dance is one of the perfect exercises for body
so I have created a bridge to user and trainer in this covid pandemic
