# Dance-Studio

This is the first project in my educational career, and it is a java-based project In this project for user validations, I used JavaScript HTML and CSS for web development -, And by using java I created servlets and JSP for frontend connective to backend
In the backend -, I have used MySQL database for storing the data of users
Here in this project, I have given an option for both user and admin to sign
This whole idea of this project from Covid times when everyone wants to get fit to survive in the global pandemic 
It is a fitness project mainly focused on dancing why because we donâ€™t  require major equipment from dance  those who are interested in dance or want to be physically healthy 
Dance is the perfect exercise for the body so I have created a bridge for users and trainers
