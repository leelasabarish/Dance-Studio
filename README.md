# Dance-Studio
This is my first mini project in my educational career, and it is a java-based project In this project for user validations, I used JavaScript HTML and CSS for web development -, And by using java I created servlets and JSP for frontend connective to backend
In the backend -, I have used MySQL database for storing the data of users
Here in this project, I have given an option for both user and admin to sign
This whole project those who are interested in dance or dance is one of the perfect exercises for the body so I have created a bridge to users and trainers in this covid pandemic
